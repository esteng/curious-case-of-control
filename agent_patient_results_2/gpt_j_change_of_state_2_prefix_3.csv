The answer to your question is yes.
The verb ""accumulate"" is a transitive verb, which means that it takes a direct object.  The direct object is the thing that is being accumulated.  In this case, the direct object is ""points"".  The verb ""accumulate"" is a transitive verb, so the direct object must be a noun.  The noun ""points"" is a count noun, so it must be plural.  The plural form of ""points"" is ""points"".
